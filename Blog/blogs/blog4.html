                    <p>Just as with people, pets need routine medical and dental care. Budgeting for these regular expenses as well as for emergencies is a good idea.<br> Typical medical expenses include:<br>

                        <ul ><li>check-ups</li>
                        <li>Vaccinations</li>
                        <li>Dental cleanings</li>
                        <li>First-aid/emergency treatment</li></ul><br>
                        Find a veterinarian in your area to help you navigate the vaccination and treatment options that are best for your new pet.<br><b>Grooming </b>is another important factor when it comes to keeping your pet healthy and happy. Some breeds require professional dematting and regular hair cuts while others need only to be brushed regularly. Ask your veterinarian or local groomer about the routine and grooming regularity that’s right for your pet.<br>

                        You’ll also need a few products and tools to keep your pet cute and coiffed at home:<br>
                        
                        <ul><li>Shampoo</li>
                          <li>Conditioner or hair/skin moisturizer for pets with dry/irritated skin</li>  
                            <li>Pet-friendly toothbrush and toothpaste</li>
                           <li> Towels</li>
                           <li> Nail clippers</li></ul>
                       <b>Exercise</b>  is another crucial element of overall health. Exercise needs vary based on breed, age, and overall health of your pet. While some dogs need multiple long walks daily, others do well with indoor activities. As a general rule, dogs need at least 30-45 of exercise daily but this is a bare minimum. Similarly, cats need different degrees of activity and can be at greater risk of becoming sedentary if they spend all of their time indoors.</p>
