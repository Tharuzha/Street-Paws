                    <p>Becoming a new pet parent is a big responsibility and there is a lot to know. Here are some commonly asked questions from other pet parents that will help you prepare for, and welcome, your new pet.<br>

                       <b> Q: What are the main challenges with pet ownership?</b><br>
                        
                        A: Becoming a pet owner is a big commitment and responsibility, and one that should not be taken lightly. Dogs and cats are social animals and need companionship to thrive in addition to ongoing food, shelter, exercise, medical care, attention, and love. Certain breeds of dogs can live upwards of 17 years and cats up to 20 or more! So that length of commitment to caring and financially providing for a pet can be a challenge for some, and should be given serious consideration and thought before bringing a new pet into your home.<br>
                        
                        Some new pet owners find the change to their schedule, financial investment, and time commitments challenging at first. That said, in this dog parents’ guide and new cat guide, we review some of the most important ways you can help create a happy, nurturing home for you and your new pet.<br>
                        
                       <b> Q: What are the benefits of having a pet?</b><br>
                        
                        A: It’s hard to quantify the many benefits of having a pet in your life. To so many, pets are the constant companion that enriches life in immeasurable ways. Most people find that having a cat or dog provides them with companionship and unconditional love, a sense of security, reduces their stress, and makes them feel more engaged in their everyday life. And, the feeling seems to be mutual! Our pets thrive on our love, attention, and care, and enjoy spending their time at our side.<br>
                        
                        <b>Q: How often does my new pet need to go to the vet?</b><br>
                        
                        A: Most dogs and cats require at least an annual check-up as well as regular vaccinations to stay healthy. However, the frequency and need for your pet to see their veterinarian will vary depending on their age, breed and unique individual needs. Consult with your local veterinarian for a health plan that is tailored specifically for your pet.<br>
                        
                      <b>Q: How much exercise does my dog need?</b>  <br>
                        
                        A: At minimum, your dog should get 30-45 minutes of exercise a day, ideally outdoors. The amount and type of exercise depends upon the age, breed, and health of your dog. We recommend discussing what’s right for your pet with your veterinarian.<br>
                        
                      <b> Q: How much exercise does my cat need?</b> <br>
                        
                        A: Contrary to popular belief, indoor cats need exercise too. We recommend engaging your cat in indoor play daily using a variety of toys that prompt them to chase, jump, and track. Experts agree that 30 minutes per day of moderate exercise is appropriate for most cats, however it’s best practice to speak with your veterinarian to decide what’s right for your pet.</p>
