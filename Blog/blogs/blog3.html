                    <p>While your excitement level is high, the pets currently living in your home may be less enthusiastic about welcoming a new member. To be fair, this is likely coming as a surprise (shock, even!) to them. One day it’s business as usual, the next there is a stranger living amongst them.<br>

                        The good news is that pets can happily coexist if you oversee their introduction and support steady integration. Here are a few tips on how to introduce new pets:<br>
                        
                        <b>01.Take it slow and steady</b><br>
                        While bringing home a new pet is exciting, resist the urge to surprise your existing pets with new companions. Building rapport will take some time, so be sure to plan ahead for their formal introduction with a few small steps.<br>
                        <b>02.Neutral ground</b><br>
                        Some pets are instinctively territorial at home, so whenever possible, introduce them to new pets in a neutral space — ideally outdoors. For instance, dogs introduced at the dog park have the chance to interact socially without the tension that may arise from an at-home introduction.<br>
                        <b>03.Separate rooms</b><br>
                        To give everyone a chance to adjust on their own time, plan to keep pets separated at first. If possible, during their first days in their new home, set up space in a different room for your pet outfitted with their bed, food, water, toys, and a litter box for new cats.<br>
                        <b>04.Let them sniff</b><br>
                        If your current pet is crate-trained, try keeping them in their crate and allowing the new dog or cat the opportunity to explore their new home and sniff out their new house mate. You can also try moving some of each pet's items into separate rooms so that they become acquainted with their scent.<br>
                       <b>05.Maintain your routine</b> <br>
                        This will be a period of adjustment for everyone in your home. Keeping a consistent routine throughout the transition helps both your current and new pets adjust to each other, their space, and to you. And, it helps them feel at home in their new space.<br>
                        <b>06.Stay vigilant and step in if needed</b><br>
                        When your pets finally meet face-to-face, be aware that there may still be tension, even if you’ve slowly moved through steps 1-5. Be ready to step in and separate them if necessary. Watch for aggressive or stressed body language. If you see it, give your pets some space from each other and try again in a few hours or days. Be patient, it will get easier!</p>
