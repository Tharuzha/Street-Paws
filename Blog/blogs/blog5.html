                    <p>We know our pets need a healthy & nutritious diet to live a happy & fulfilling life. To stay fit, they need exercise & an equally good diet. It is important to strike a balance between the two. But how do we know if we are able to fulfill our pet’s nutritional needs? What all needs to be taken care of? <br>

                        <b>Do pets need a balanced diet too?</b><br>
                        
                        Yes. Just like us, our pets also need a balanced diet. An imbalanced diet can cause chronic & severe heart & liver problems in pets. Our pets are carnivores in nature. They have evolved from wild animals but due to their domestication, their needs have changed. Although a diet is usually prescribed depending upon the age, height, weight, breed, etc, few nutrients are essential for their well being.<br>

                        <b>Some tips to follow in order to maintain your pet’s nutritional needs are as follows: </b><br>
                        
                        Check the label of your pet’s food. The first 5 ingredients form the bulk. A simple check would ensure whether your pet is being fed the right kind of food or not. <br>
                        
                        <ul><li>Opt for wet food which is made with fresh ingredients like chicken, fish, vegetables & infused with healthy oils like hemp seed oil for dogs and fish oil for cats.</li>
                            <li>Wet food should also include healthy ingredients like Probiotics. They are gut-friendly bacterias that keep your pet healthy, their skin shining, and promote their overall well being.  </li>
                            <li> Avoid any food items which have added sugar, salts, gluten, xylitol, GMO, etc. Your pets don’t need toxicity in their food.</li> 
                             </ul>
