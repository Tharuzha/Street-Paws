                    <p>Congratulations! You may be wondering if you have all that you need to help your pet adjust and thrive in their new environment.<br>

                        You’ve already got ample amounts of love for your new pet, but in this dog parents’ guide and new cat guide, you’ll learn that you also need a few supplies and some safety precautions:<br>
                        
                       <b> Supplies</b><br>
                        Your new pet is going to eat, sleep, play, and poop on repeat. So naturally you’ll need to invest in food, treats, bowls, a pet bed, crate/carrier, collar/harness, leash, poop bags/litter box, toys, and perhaps a baby gate for safe play and to restrict access to certain areas of your home.<br>
                        
                        <b>Safety</b><br>
                        These are the less-fun but super important considerations for your new pet. Pet-proofing your space means checking for gaps in fencing, broken gates, creating a pet emergency kit, and safely storing household hazards such as poisonous plants, cleaning chemicals, and removing items that pose a choking hazard for pets who like to chew.<br>
                        
                        Outfitting your new pet with safety gear is important too. Affixed to your pet’s collar should be an external ID tag with their new address and your contact information. And for the most comprehensive protection, microchipping your pet is strongly recommended, as it’s the only permanent, reliable way to identify them if they become lost. It also provides the best chances of being reunited with your pet if they ever go missing.</p>
